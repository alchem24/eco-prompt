# eco-prompt
Developer utility that optimizes LLM payloads before they leave your device. It creates a "zipped" version of your natural language prompts, saving developers money on token costs and reducing inference latency. Features real-time "Cost Saved" metrics and a semantic integrity check to ensure your compressed prompt still works perfectly.
